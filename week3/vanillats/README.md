# Exercise 1

To see result of exercise 1, go through the following steps:

- clone project
- run `cd week3/vanillats`
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev`

I made a file src/alerter.ts and implemented a function that takes an HTMLDivElement as the argument. It creates and input field and a button, which it then appends to the HTMLDivElement. This function is imported and used in src/main.ts.

# Exercise 2

To see result of exercise 2, go through the following steps:

- clone project
- run `cd week3/vanillats`
- run `npm install`
- run `ts-node-esm src/Person.ts`

I made a file src/Person.ts with a class Person + an object of type Person verifying its methods..
